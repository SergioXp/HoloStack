## 🌟 What is HoloStack?

HoloStack was born from a simple need: **Private and fast Pokémon TCG collection management.** 

Unlike public cloud services where your data is stored on someone else's server, HoloStack runs **locally** on your machine. Your SQLite database stays in your folder, your data is yours, and the app is lightning fast because it's right there with you.

### Core Philosophy:
1.  **Privacy First**: Your collection data is sensitive. We keep it off the cloud.
2.  **Ease of Use**: No complex database setups. Docker handles everything.
3.  **Community Driven**: Designed by and for collectors.
